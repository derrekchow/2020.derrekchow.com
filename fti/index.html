				Creating a magazine, brand, and site for a blog that champions Asian/Anglo-Asian art in entertainment

			<p>
                <a href="https://fromtheintercom.com/" target="_blank">From the Intercom</a> is an online blog that began in 2018 as an effort to highlight Asian/Anglo-Asian creators in film, music, and other creative industries. We interview artists, attend film festivals, review songs/albums, highlight new releases, and more.
                <br/><br/>
                When I joined as a designer, my mission was to create a recognizable brand for the site as well as experiment with additional mediums in which we could get our message across.
			</p>
			<h5>Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival Posters</h5>
			<p>
				Below are posters created for a series of interviews we did at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival with actors, directors, and producers. My goal was to have each poster highlight a particular film but also feel a part of a collection.

            <h5>Mood Board</h5>
            <p>
				In brainstorming a new brand for <a href="https://fromtheintercom.com/" target="_blank">From the Intercom</a>, I created a mood board for inspiration. The board is a collection of films, sites, art, albums covers, colors, and other random visuals.
				<br/><br/>
				<a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/E73UHY1NKCY/" target="_blank">See the full mood board here.</a><br/><br/>

			<h5>New Brand</h5>
			<p>
				Below are some abstract graphics and typography used to created and express the ideas of the new brand for <a href="https://fromtheintercom.com/" target="_blank">From the Intercom</a>. I wanted something simple yet expressive, the design is inspired by the shape of Cyrillic, Greek, and Latin scripts which I enlarged and overlayed against various backgrounds.

            <h5>From the Intercom Magazine - Issue 01</h5>
            <p>
                This new brand was applied to a magazine created to celebrate the blog's 1st anniversary as well as other promo material. We compiled a collection of our favourites reviews, stories, and interviews in a single magazine.
                <br/><br/>
                You can order the full magazine <a href="https://fromtheintercom.com/first-anniversary-zine/">here</a>, we also sell them in a few record stores.

            <h5>What's next?</h5>
            <p>
				The website has been updated with a cleaner, simpler design but I want to apply the new brand to the site. For the magazine, Issue 02 is intended to be more experimental in both design and content.
				<br/><br/>
				I am also applying our new brand to all future material, examples are shown below:

			<h5>Thanks</h5>
			<p>
				Thank you to my friend Li-Wei Chu for expanding my music taste, who leads and writes almost everything at <a href="https://fromtheintercom.com/" target="_blank">From the Intercom</a> and whose writing output is extraordinary in both quality and quantity.
